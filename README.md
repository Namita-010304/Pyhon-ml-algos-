Algorithms Covered
1. Linear Regression
Used for predicting continuous outcomes. Example: predicting house prices based on features like area, rooms, etc.


2. Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression by fitting a nonlinear relationship between features and output.


3. Logistic Regression
A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (Yes/No, 0/1).


4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Classifies data based on the majority label of nearest k neighbors. Simple and non-parametric.


5. Naive Bayes
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem. Works well for text classification and categorical features.


6. Decision Tree
A flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a decision on a feature.


7. Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy and reduced overfitting.


8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes. Good for high-dimensional spaces.


9. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework.
